Basic setting
-------------
- ECHSE: engine 'test_soilwat'
- soil: Bruno não Cálcico from Bengue catchment in NE Brazil, 6 horizons (top horizons split into 2 in ECHSE), profile depth: 74 cm
	- vertical discretisation of Hydrus is much finer by default!
- infiltration model: 3: Green-Ampt two-stage for layered soil
- percolation: 2: Matric potential gradient (simple vertical Richards' equation)
- soil retention model: 1: Van Genuchten
- ode solver: 36: linear multistep backward differentiation formula (BDF) method in Nordsieck form
- forcing: different rainfall impulses with different intensities within the first two days (total: 134 mm)
- hourly time steps in ECHSE; Hydrus: adaptive
- initial soil moisture states set to field capacity


Comparison with hydrus
----------------------
- ECHSE with basic setting vs. Hydrus 1D with same soil parameterisation as used for ECHSE
- evolution of matric potential and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity matched well by ECHSE (i.e., similar to Hydrus)
- cumulated infiltration similar: ~64mm (Hydrus) vs. ~59mm (ECHSE)
- percolation: peak of Hydrus (mm/h) lower and a little more delayed compared to ECHSE but almost exactly matching falling limb
- surface runoff: 
	- only after first and heavy rainfall event (100mm/h) in both models
	- ~73mm (Hydrus) vs. ~64mm (ECHSE)
- soil water content evolution:
	- very similar (peak for ECHSE higher)
	- horizont-wise evolution matches quite well


Influence of vertical resolution
--------------------------------
- tried more coarse and finer vertical resolutions in ECHSE
	- coarse: 5 horizonts (first horizon not sub-divided)
	- fine: 10 horizons (every horizon split into two with the same parameterisation)
	- hyper: 20 horizons (every horizon split into four with the same parameterisation)
- coarse resolution: higher infiltration, less surface runoff, more rapid percolation
- finer resolution: less infiltration, more surface runoff, delayed percolation


Influence of temporal resolution
--------------------------------
- daily rainfall input but hourly simulation time steps in ECHSE
	- daily rainfall sum equally distributed to hours of the day
	- much more infiltration, no surface runoff, more and more rapid percolation, soil water content exceeds upper limit
- different simulation time steps in ECHSE (rainfall input adjusted accordingly
	- finer resolution: more infiltration, infiltration into deeper horizons, higher percolation, less surface runoff


Parameter kscal
---------------
- influence of scaling parameter for saturated hydraulic conductivity 'scale_ks'
	- ksat_eff = ksat / scale_ks
	- introduced in WASA to compensate for underestimated rainfall intensities when running the model with daily time steps
	- scale_ks determined as the ratio of average rainfall intensities of high resolution data to average rainfall intensities of data with model temporal resolution
	- value of 15 determined for Ceará, NE Brazil
	- can also be calibrated
- results:
	- almost no impact on simulated infiltration and surface runoff volumes; large impact on percolation
	- soil water movement appears to be strongly delayed, water stays in soil profile for longer time
	- no compensation effect can be observed when comparing to hourly simulations
